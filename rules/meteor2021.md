Meteor 2021
===========
Skill Shot
----------
At the start of the ball, the rollovers and METEOR drop target lights will flash.
Hitting either of those achieves a skill shot.

Normal Gameplay
---------------
During the course of normal play, the rules of Meteor are similar to the original.

Banks of 3 drop targets award bonus lights. Completing the METEOR drop targets advances the Bonus X, and the spinner value is controlled by how many METEOR targets are down

When the METEOR targets are cleared, a Meteor Storm will begin.

Meteor Storm
------------
Meteors are represented by flashing lights descending on the bonus light array. A rocket can be armed by hitting one of the associated drop targets. For example, if a meteor is dropping in the first column, hitting one of the three 1 drop targets will arm a rocket in that sector.

There are three ways to fire a rocket:
1) Arming a rocket through the drop target and then hitting the Stand Up target to launch.
2) Hitting the dead bumper (only for 1 and 3) of the associated sector.
3) Clearing the drop target bank for the associated sector.

Note: methods 2) and 3) above are available for the first meteor storm. Following
an Orpheus round, those methods are curtailed.

Once all meteors in the storm have been cleared, an Orpheus round begins.

Orpheus Round
-------------
All METEOR targets are lowered and the player is warned of Orpheus incoming. Then, two or more targets are raised and are accompanied by a WOW light. The player is asked to drop only the lit target. If all Orpheus targets are cleared, Orpheus will be completed and the player will be awarded with a mode where all switches are worth a large award for a period of time. Then, regular play will resume.

If an unlit Orpheus target is hit, the player will enter the Orpheus Fragmented mode. During that mode, all raised drops have to be hit before they reset. Once that is accomplished, the player will be awarded with a brief switch reward.

Super Spinner
-------------
During normal play (not Meteor Storm or Orpheus), spinner hits are count down towards 0 in the Credits display. Once the player reaches 0 spins left, they will engage in Super Spinner for a period of time. The spinner lights will flash and spins will be worth 4x value. This mode is timed, unless the user enters a Meteor storm while the spinner reward is running (then the timer is frozen).

Max Bonus
---------
At any time, if the player maxes out all three bonus columns, they will achieve the Max Bonus reward. For the rest of the ball, the bonus lights will flash to display this reward.

Wizard Mode
-----------
If the player achieves all four goals over the course of a game, they will enter the Wizard Mode. The four goals are:
1) Meteor Storm > Orpheus > Orpheus Fragmented & Completed
2) Meteor Storm > Orpheus > Completed
3) Super Spinner
4) Max Bonus

Upon completion of the four goals and resumption of regular play, Wizard Mode will begin. During the Wizard Mode period, all switches are worth a large value and clearing banks of 3 targets will award a Jackpot. Clearing the METEOR targets awards a Super Jackpot.
